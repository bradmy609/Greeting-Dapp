# Greeting Dapp

This is my first decentralized application, made using Truffle and Ganache. It is a very simple app that helped me understand the basics of how Ganache, Truffle, and Dapp development works. After installing dependencies and setting up local blockchain network, you can launch the dapp by running server.js with Node, and then connect to the dapp using metamask in the browser.

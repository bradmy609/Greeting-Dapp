# Greeting Dapp

This is my first decentralized application, made using Truffle and Ganache. It is a very simple app that I made to help others understand Ganache, Truffle, and Dapp development. After installing dependencies and setting up local blockchain network, you can launch the dapp by running server.js with Node, and then connect to the dapp using metamask in the browser.
